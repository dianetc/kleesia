      "Many people view LLMs (large language models) as databases of compressed world knowledge. Just like databases, they deliver answers to given user queries. Rather than rows and columns—as in a relational database—an LLM’s knowledge is encoded into billions (or even trillions) of weights that are learned  during pretraining and subsequent fine-tuning. Additionally, LLMs are not queried using a synthetic language such as SQL but instead directly by the user, who can engage with them via natural-language conversations. The conceptual equivalent of a query engine inside an LLM..",
